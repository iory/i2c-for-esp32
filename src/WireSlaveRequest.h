/**
 * Modified based on https://github.com/gutierrezps/ESP32_I2C_Slave
 *
 * This class is made to wrap the requestFrom() from default
 * Wire library. It requests data from an ESP32 slave (packed
 * using WirePacker) until a complete packet is received. It
 * also retries and handles errors.
 *
 * After creating an object, call the request() method.
 * If a packet was read correctly, use methods available()
 * and read() to get the payload bytes.
 *
 * Use setRetryDelay() and setAttemps() if errors are
 * happening frequently.
